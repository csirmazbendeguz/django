How to define a composite primary key
=====================================

In Django, each model has a primary key. By default, this primary key consists
of a single field.

In most cases, a single primary key should suffice. In database design,
however, defining a primary key consisting of multiple fields is sometimes
necessary.

To define a composite primary key, set the model's ``pk`` to an instance of
``CompositePrimaryKey``:

.. code-block:: pycon

    class Tenant(models.Model):
        pass

    class User(models.Model):
        pk = models.CompositePrimaryKey("tenant_id", "id")
        tenant = models.ForeignKey(Tenant, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        id = models.IntegerField()

This will instruct Django to create a composite primary key
(``PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, id)``) when creating the table.

It's possible to define a composite primary key consisting of a single field.
This is _almost_ the same as setting ``primary_key=True`` on the field.

.. code-block:: pycon

    class Foo(models.Model):
        pk = models.CompositePrimaryKey("id")
        id = models.IntegerField()

Changes to *pk*
===============

In Django, composite primary keys are represented with ``tuple``\s:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> user = User.objects.create(tenant_id=1, id=2)
    >>> user.pk
    (1, 2)
    >>> foo = Foo(id=1)
    >>> foo.pk
    (1,)

You may assign ``tuple``\s to composite ``pk``\s:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> user = User(pk=(1, 3))
    >>> user.pk
    (1, 3)
    >>> user.tenant_id
    1
    >>> user.id
    3

Or filter composite ``pk``\s by ``tuple``\s:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> User.objects.filter(pk=(1, 2)).count()
    1

Migrating to a composite primary key
====================================

As of now, Django doesn't offer built-in support for the migration of primary
keys.

This means once a table is created, its primary key cannot be changed via
Django's migration operations, regardless of whether the table was created
with a regular primary key or a composite primary key.

If you would like to migrate an existing table from a single primary key to a
composite primary key, follow your database backend's instructions to do so.

Once the composite primary key is in place, add the ``CompositePrimaryKey``
field to your model. This allows Django to recognize and handle the composite
primary key appropriately.

.. note::

    While migration operations (e.g. ``AddField``, ``AlterField``) on
    primary key fields are not supported, ``makemigrations`` will still detect
    changes.

    In order to avoid errors, it's recommended to apply such migrations with
    ``--fake``.

    Alternatively, :class:`.SeparateDatabaseAndState` may be used to execute
    the backend-specific migrations and Django-generated migrations in
    a single operation.

How to define a composite foreign key
=====================================

At the moment, relationship fields (``ForeignKey``, ``OneToOneField``,
``ManyToManyField``) don't support composite primary keys.

So, given the ``Tenant`` and ``User`` models, we cannot do:

.. code-block:: pycon

    class Comment(models.Model):
        user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)  # êÑÇ ERROR

Because ``ForeignKey`` cannot reference models with composite primary keys
*yet*.

To work around this limitation, ``ForeignObject`` can be used as an
alternative:

.. code-block:: pycon

    class Comment(models.Model):
        tenant = models.ForeignKey(Tenant, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        user_id = models.IntegerField()
        user = models.ForeignObject(
            User,
            on_delete=models.CASCADE,
            from_fields=("tenant_id", "user_id"),
            to_fields=("tenant_id", "id"),
        )

``ForeignObject`` is much like ``ForeignKey``,
except that it doesn't create any columns (e.g. ``user_id``), foreign key
constraints or indexes in the database.

.. warning::

    ``ForeignObject`` is an internal API. The work to provide a public API for
    composite foreign keys is already under way. Use it at your own risk.

Composite primary keys and generic relations
============================================

The composite primary key feature is still in its infancy, it doesn't
support generic relations yet.

The work to add composite primary key support to generic relations
hasn't started yet.

Composite primary keys and database functions
=============================================

The database functions may not work with composite primary keys.

This is because most database functions accept a single field only.

.. code-block:: sql

    COUNT("id")  -- ‚úì OK
    COUNT("tenant_id", "id")  -- êÑÇ ERROR

So, unless the database function accepts multiple fields, don't
use it with a composite primary key directly.

.. code-block:: pycon

    Count("id")  -- ‚úì OK
    Count("pk")  -- êÑÇ ERROR
    Count("comment_set__id")  -- ‚úì OK
    Count("comment_set")  -- êÑÇ ERROR
